# About this Project

The global medical supply chain faces two critical challenges: drug counterfeiting and the mishandling of temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals during transportation and storage. Counterfeit medications can harm patients and undermine the trustworthiness of the entire supply chain. Similarly, improper storage and transportation of temperature-sensitive products, such as vaccines, can render them ineffective or hazardous. These issues directly impact public health outcomes. To address these challenges, our project aims to transform the pharmaceutical supply chain by utilizing blockchain technology. Blockchain provides an immutable record of every step in a drug's journey, ensuring the authenticity of medicines. Additionally, smart contracts automate key processes, ensuring quality control and sending alerts if temperatures deviate from safe parameters. Our goal is to create a transparent, efficient, and secure system that ensures the safe and timely delivery of essential medications globally.

The blockchain-based supply chain management system revolutionizes the way sensitive products, especially pharmaceuticals, are tracked and verified. Starting from the manufacturing stage, each product is assigned a QR code linked to blockchain records that document its entire journey. As products move from manufacturers to consumers, these QR codes are scanned at each step, updating the blockchain with real-time information. This ensures transparency and traceability, allowing stakeholders to verify the authenticity and history of each item. Additionally, sensor-equipped vehicles monitor environmental conditions during transit, integrating this data into the blockchain to prevent damage. This system enhances the entire supply chain by providing a secure, transparent, and reliable framework for managing and tracking products from production to delivery.

# Architecture 

![Overall Architecture](https://github.com/MohammadArqham/MajorProjectReactApp/assets/87173531/cb462c06-d325-46aa-9ba4-80c0fa62e742)

The system architecture integrates the Ethereum blockchain for secure product tracking, a React.js-based front end for user interaction, and IoT devices for real-time cold chain monitoring. Ethereum’s smart contracts ensure transparent data recording, while the user-friendly front-end facilitates stakeholder engagement. IoT sensors transmit environmental data to the blockchain, enhancing real-time monitoring of the cold chain. This approach addresses drug counterfeiting and optimizes distribution by ensuring transparency, traceability, and security in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The React.js-based interface allows stakeholders to interact with real-time data, while the blockchain layer uses Ethereum's technology to securely record and verify the entire lifecycle of pharmaceutical products.
